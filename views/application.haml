		Do you use [soloist](https://github.com/mkocher/soloist)?

		This simple app will help you build your *soloistrc* file easily from a (GitHub) directory of recipes.

		Typically, this is our workflow for setting up our developer and ci machines:

				> mkdir workspace && cd workspace
				> git clone https://github.com/newcontext/pivotal_workstation

				# Build a soloistrc file by choosing from recipes in ~/workspace/pivotal_workstation/recipes

				> gem install soloist
				> soloist

		[Try it now](/build?url=https://github.com/newcontext/pivotal_workstation), or use your own Chef Cookbooks repo.
